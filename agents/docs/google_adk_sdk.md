I'll explore the ADK Python project and provide a technical overview of how to implement agents. Let me navigate through the codebase to understand its structure and functionality.

Let me first check the README to get an overview of the project.

Let me explore the directory structure to understand how the project is organized.

Let's look at the agents module since that's central to implementing agents:

Now I'll examine the content of the base_agent.py file, which likely contains the core agent implementation:

Let's look at the `llm_agent.py` file since that's the implementation for LLM-based agents:

Let's also examine the tools implementation as they are a key component for agent functionality:

Let's look at the base tool implementation:

Now, let's look at the function tool implementation, which is the most common type of tool:

Finally, let's look at how the ADK is typically used by checking a few samples:

Let's search for some example agent implementations in the repo:

Let's look at one of these example agent implementations:

Let's also look at the e-commerce customer service agent to see a more comprehensive example:

Based on my exploration of the ADK Python codebase, I'll provide a technical overview of how to implement agents using this framework:

# Technical Overview: Implementing Agents with ADK Python

## 1. Core Components of ADK Architecture

ADK (Agent Development Kit) is a flexible, modular Python framework for developing AI agents that can perform complex tasks. Here are the key components:

### 1.1 Agents

- **BaseAgent**: The foundation abstract class for all agents
- **LlmAgent**: The primary implementation for LLM-based agents (also aliased as simply `Agent`)
- **Specialized Agents**: SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LanggraphAgent, etc.

### 1.2 Tools

- **BaseTool**: Abstract base class for all tools
- **FunctionTool**: Wraps Python functions as tools for agents
- **Multiple Tool Types**: Built-in tools like retrieval, OpenAPI integrations, etc.

### 1.3 Models

- Model abstraction layers that support different LLM providers
- Primarily optimized for Gemini but model-agnostic design

### 1.4 Context & State Management

- Context objects for managing agent invocation state
- Event-based communication between components

## 2. Implementing a Basic Agent

Here's how to implement a basic agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent  # alias for LlmAgent

# Define a simple function tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for a location.

    Args:
        location (str): The location to get weather for

    Returns:
        str: The weather forecast
    """
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny and 75Â°F"

# Create the agent
weather_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",  # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful weather assistant. Answer user questions about weather using the provided tools.",
    description="A weather assistant that can provide forecasts.",
    tools=[get_weather]
)
```

## 3. Creating Multi-Agent Systems

ADK supports hierarchical multi-agent architectures:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Define specialized sub-agents
weather_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="You are a weather specialist. Provide accurate weather information.",
    tools=[get_weather]
)

location_agent = Agent(
    name="location_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="You are a location specialist. Help users find locations and landmarks.",
    tools=[find_location]
)

# Create a coordinator agent
coordinator = Agent(
    name="travel_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate travel planning assistance.",
    instruction="""You are a travel assistant coordinator.
    Delegate to specialized agents when appropriate.
    - Use weather_agent for weather questions
    - Use location_agent for location-related questions
    """,
    sub_agents=[
        weather_agent,
        location_agent
    ]
)
```

## 4. Implementing Tools

Tools provide the capabilities for agents to interact with external systems:

### 4.1 Function-Based Tools

The simplest way to implement tools is to define Python functions with type hints and docstrings:

```python
def search_database(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Search the product database for items matching the query.

    Args:
        query (str): The search terms

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of matching products with their details
    """
    # Implementation would connect to actual database
    return [{"id": "123", "name": "Example Product", "price": 19.99}]
```

### 4.2 Class-Based Tools

For more complex tools, you can create classes that inherit from `BaseTool`:

```python
from google.adk.tools import BaseTool
from google.adk.tools import ToolContext

class DatabaseTool(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        super().__init__(
            name="database_tool",
            description="Search and modify product database"
        )
        self.connection_string = connection_string

    async def run_async(self, *, args: dict[str, Any], tool_context: ToolContext) -> Any:
        # Implement database connection and operations
        operation = args.get("operation")
        if operation == "search":
            return {"results": [{"id": "123", "name": "Example Product"}]}
        # Other operations...
```

## 5. Advanced Agent Features

### 5.1 Callbacks

ADK provides extensive callback mechanisms for custom behavior:

```python
def before_agent_action(callback_context: CallbackContext) -> Optional[types.Content]:
    # Perform actions before agent runs
    print(f"Agent {callback_context.agent.name} is about to run")
    return None  # Continue normal execution

def after_model_action(callback_context: CallbackContext, llm_response: LlmResponse) -> Optional[LlmResponse]:
    # Post-process model responses
    # Modify or replace the model response if needed
    return None  # Use the original response

my_agent = Agent(
    name="agent_with_callbacks",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant.",
    before_agent_callback=before_agent_action,
    after_model_callback=after_model_action
)
```

### 5.2 Controlled Input/Output

You can define structured schemas for agent inputs and outputs:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WeatherQuery(BaseModel):
    location: str
    date: str = "today"

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    conditions: str
    humidity: float

structured_agent = Agent(
    name="structured_weather_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="You provide weather forecasts in a structured format.",
    input_schema=WeatherQuery,
    output_schema=WeatherResponse,
    tools=[get_detailed_weather]
)
```

### 5.3 State Management

ADK agents can maintain state between interactions:

```python
def track_user_preference(callback_context: CallbackContext) -> None:
    # Extract and store user preferences in state
    if "preferences" not in callback_context.state:
        callback_context.state["preferences"] = {}

    # Update state based on conversation
    message = callback_context.history[-1]
    if "prefer" in message.text.lower():
        # Extract preference and store it
        callback_context.state["preferences"]["color"] = "blue"
```

## 6. Deployment Options

ADK provides several deployment options:

### 6.1 Development UI

```bash
# Launch the development UI for testing
adk dev --agent ./my_agent.py
```

### 6.2 Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate agent against test cases
adk eval ./my_agent.py ./test_cases.evalset.json
```

### 6.3 Containerization

ADK agents can be containerized and deployed to services like Cloud Run or Vertex AI Agent Engine.

## 7. Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**:

   - Create specialized agents for distinct capabilities
   - Use hierarchical architectures for complex tasks
   - Provide clear, specific instructions to each agent

2. **Tool Implementation**:

   - Create focused tools with clear documentation
   - Implement proper error handling and input validation
   - Use type hints and detailed docstrings

3. **Testing and Evaluation**:

   - Create comprehensive test cases
   - Use the evaluation framework to assess agent performance
   - Iterate on agent design based on evaluation results

4. **Deployment**:
   - Start with the development UI for testing
   - Containerize for production deployment
   - Implement monitoring and logging

## 8. Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of a customer service agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Define tools
def get_order_status(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Get the status of an order.

    Args:
        order_id (str): The order identifier

    Returns:
        str: Current status of the order
    """
    # Implementation would connect to order database
    return "PENDING"

def cancel_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Cancel an order if it's in PENDING state.

    Args:
        order_id (str): The order identifier

    Returns:
        str: Confirmation message
    """
    # Implementation would update order in database
    return f"Order {order_id} has been canceled."

# Create the agent
customer_service_agent = Agent(
    name="customer_service",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
    You are a customer service agent for an e-commerce store.
    Help customers with order inquiries, cancellations, and other issues.
    Always verify order status before attempting cancellation.
    Be polite and helpful at all times.
    """,
    tools=[get_order_status, cancel_order]
)
```

This overview provides the foundation for implementing agents with ADK Python. The framework's modular architecture allows for custom extensions and adaptations to meet specific use cases.
