# Top 7 Reasoning-Driven Dev-Helper Agent Ideas

## 1. Refactor Opportunity Scout (Agent #11)

**What it reasons about:** Detects code smells (duplication, long methods, complex conditions) across the entire repository graph and proposes coordinated refactors that span multiple files.

**When it runs:** Nightly job or on-demand by developers

**Typical outputs:**
- Multi-file refactor plans with priority tags
- Estimated complexity reduction metrics  
- Step-by-step refactoring approach to maintain backward compatibility
- Auto-generated PRs for simple extractions

**Value proposition:** Proactively identifies technical debt and provides actionable refactoring roadmaps, preventing codebase degradation over time.

## 2. Test-Gap Oracle (Agent #4)

**What it reasons about:** Analyzes code paths versus existing test coverage to predict untested branches and edge cases

**When it runs:** After CI passes (green builds)

**Typical outputs:**
- Ranked list of pytest/Jest test skeletons
- Coverage gap analysis with criticality ratings
- Auto-generated test cases for simple scenarios
- Integration test suggestions for complex flows

**Value proposition:** Ensures comprehensive test coverage by intelligently identifying testing blind spots that traditional coverage tools miss.

## 3. GraphQL Contract Validator (Agent #15)

**What it reasons about:** Evaluates GraphQL schema changes against existing client queries to detect breaking API changes

**When it runs:** On any GraphQL SDL file changes

**Typical outputs:**
- Breaking/non-breaking change verdict
- Auto-generated compatibility patches for clients
- Migration guides for unavoidable breaking changes
- Client impact analysis report

**Value proposition:** Prevents API-breaking changes from reaching production by reasoning about schema evolution impact on all consumers.

## 4. Dead-Feature Flag Reaper (Agent #12)

**What it reasons about:** Analyzes feature flag configurations and runtime metrics to identify flags that are 100% rolled out or completely unreferenced

**When it runs:** Weekly scheduled job

**Typical outputs:**
- PRs removing stale feature flags
- Clean configuration diffs
- Historical rollout timeline
- Risk assessment for flag removal

**Value proposition:** Automates technical debt cleanup by identifying and removing obsolete feature flags, keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## 5. Config-Drift Detective (Agent #19)

**What it reasons about:** Compares desired-state configurations with live infrastructure state to identify and explain configuration drift

**When it runs:** Hourly or triggered by alerts

**Typical outputs:**
- Human-readable drift reports
- Root cause analysis of drift
- Auto-generated remediation scripts
- Drift prevention recommendations

**Value proposition:** Maintains infrastructure consistency by detecting and explaining configuration drift before it causes production issues.

## 6. Regression-Cause Bisector (Agent #25)

**What it reasons about:** Analyzes failing tests and commit history to determine the minimal set of commits that could have introduced the regression

**When it runs:** When CI turns red

**Typical outputs:**
- Ordered suspect commit list
- Auto-generated git bisect scripts
- Confidence scores for each suspect commit
- Recommended rollback strategy

**Value proposition:** Dramatically reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR) by intelligently narrowing down regression causes.

## 7. Accessibility Audit Mentor (Agent #16)

**What it reasons about:** Uses axe-core and heuristic reasoning on UI diffs to identify accessibility issues and prioritize WCAG AA blockers

**When it runs:** On any frontend MR/PR

**Typical outputs:**
- Inline accessibility issues with fix snippets
- Severity rankings following WCAG standards
- Educational explanations of violations
- Automated fixes for common issues

**Value proposition:** Ensures products are accessible to all users while educating developers on accessibility best practices.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
Start with agents that provide immediate value with minimal integration:
- Test-Gap Oracle (#4)
- Dead-Feature Flag Reaper (#12)
- Accessibility Audit Mentor (#16)

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
Add agents that reason about system-wide patterns:
- Refactor Opportunity Scout (#11)
- Config-Drift Detective (#19)

### Phase 3: Specialized Reasoning
Deploy domain-specific agents:
- GraphQL Contract Validator (#15)
- Regression-Cause Bisector (#25)

### Integration Patterns

1. **Parallel Execution**: Agents 11, 12, and 16 can run independently after repo clone
2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Agent 25 depends on CI status; Agent 4 runs after successful builds
3. **Event-Driven**: Agents 15, 16, and 19 trigger on specific file changes or system events
4. **Scheduled**: Agents 11 and 12 run on regular intervals

### Key Success Factors

1. **Incremental Rollout**: Start with advisory mode before enabling automated actions
2. **Developer Education**: Include explanations and learning resources in agent outputs
3. **Customization**: Allow teams to configure thresholds and priorities
4. **Performance**: Ensure agent execution doesn't slow down CI/CD pipelines
5. **Observability**: Track agent effectiveness and developer satisfaction metrics
